Enter the address and monitor your server health status.

Usage is very simple - open the page and insert servers with their URL (HTTP and HTTPS supported). Once server are entered they are stored in local storage. 


Server status checks will be performed by using client side Web Socket technology. However, your server does not need to support it.
