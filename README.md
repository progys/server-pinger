server-pinger
===================

About
---------
Enter the address and monitor your server health status.

How to use it?
----------------
Usage is very simple - open the page and insert servers with their URL (HTTP and HTTPS supported). Entered servers are stored in browser local storage.

How it works?
-----------------
Status checker will try to connect to server by using client side Web Socket technology. However, server does not need to support it as status will be reported anyway.

Why I created it ?
------------------
I created this page for my friend - he wanted to have very simple page to see if its servers are alive.
For me it was an opportunity to have some real hands-on experience with AngularJS.
